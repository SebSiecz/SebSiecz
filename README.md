# Hey 👋

I'm Seb, a software engineer 👨‍💻 specialising in backend development in **Node.js** and deploying to **AWS** and **Azure** clouds ☁️

The most recent project, I was the lead backend engineer on a heavily customizable, CMS-driven, subscription-based audio streaming app for iOS. The backend was written in TypeScript, with a PostgreSQL database, RevenueCat _for subscriptions_, Firebase _for auth and notifications_, and Contentful _as the CMS_. The backend API was deployed to AWS via Pulumi. I have also written a [blog post](https://www.strv.com/blog/building-a-contentful-driven-audio-streaming-app-engineering-product) outlining how contentful was levaraged to build the app dynaimcally without the need for a custom built admin panel.

On a previous project, I was the key contributor on a debt portfolio management platform using .Net Core 3 with GraphQL, Identity Server 4 for auth, MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and deploying using Pulumi to Azure.

In the past I've worked on a couple of different online retail sites, mainly writing backends in node.js (both JS and TS) using microservice architectures.
