# Hey üëã

I'm Seb, a software engineer üë®‚Äçüíª specialising in backend development in **Node.js** and deploying to **AWS** and **Azure** clouds ‚òÅÔ∏è

## What I'm working on recently?

*TL;DR* - Node.js APIs written in Typescript deployed via Pulumi onto AWS Fargate in docker containers, with a strong emphasis on security and user data privacy.

The most notable recent project, I was the lead backend engineer on a heavily customizable, CMS-driven, subscription-based audio streaming app for iOS. The backend was written in TypeScript, with a PostgreSQL database, RevenueCat _for subscriptions_, Firebase _for auth and notifications_, and Contentful _as the CMS_. The backend API was deployed to AWS via Pulumi. I have also written a [blog post](https://www.strv.com/blog/building-a-contentful-driven-audio-streaming-app-engineering-product) outlining how contentful was levaraged to build the app dynaimcally without the need for a custom built admin panel.

Recently I have been interested more in the security of APIs after finding some vulnerabilities on an API a collegue has been working on, which has sparked this interest for me, so upon digging more and completing that security investigation, I started doing some research and took a couple online courses from which I prepared a couple of presentations internally for my current compnay, one for the QA team on what they can look out for and how they can catch some of these security issues, and another for the Backend team on what are some common vulnerabilities and shown them a `Hacker's view on API Security`.

On a previous project, I was the key contributor on a debt portfolio management platform using .Net Core 3 with GraphQL, Identity Server 4 for auth, MongoDB and PostgreSQL, and deploying using Pulumi to Azure.

In the past I've worked on a couple of different online retail sites, mainly writing backends in node.js (both JS and TS) using microservice architectures.
