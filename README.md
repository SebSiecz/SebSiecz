# 👋 Welcome

I'm Seb, a backend engineer specializing in **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and cloud deployments on **AWS**. My main focus is on headless CMS platforms — especially ContentStack and Contentful — covering everything from content modelling and management to complex migrations and platform optimizations.

I lead backend development for CMS-driven projects, handling content migration (JSON and web scraping), automation, and API integrations. Currently, working on a ContentStack / Next.js / GraphQL stack website for an international cyber security company already in production. Earlier, I architected the backend for a customizable audio streaming app, leveraging Contentful for dynamic content, with a stack including TypeScript, PostgreSQL, RevenueCat, Firebase, and AWS (via Pulumi).

I'm passionate about API security, having researched vulnerabilities, completed security courses, and shared insights with my teams via presentations and knowledge sharing sessions.

Previously, I contributed to fintech and e-commerce platforms using .NET Core, GraphQL, Identity Server, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Azure.
